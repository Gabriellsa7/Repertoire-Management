# Band Repertoire Management System üéµ

This project is a **Band Repertoire Management System** developed as part of the Web Development 1 course at Information Systems. The goal of the system is to streamline the management of band repertoires by synchronizing all band members with a designated "lead" user. This ensures that all members follow the same repertoire structure and commands in real-time.

## üìù Features

- **Centralized Management**: 
  - A lead musician can register, create a band, and invite members to join.
  - The lead manages the repertoire (add, reorder, and remove songs), which is synchronized across all band members.

- **Repertoire Handling**:
  - Songs are uploaded as PDF files for easy and consistent display.
  - Removed songs are not permanently deleted but archived for re-inclusion without re-uploading.

- **Multi-Band Membership**:
  - A musician can participate in multiple bands.
  - A band can have only one lead or multiple members as needed.

- **Real-Time Synchronization**:
  - During a live performance, the lead musician can control song transitions for all devices in the band, ensuring synchronization in real time.

- **User Authentication**:
  - All musicians must authenticate to access the system.
